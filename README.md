# MA_305_Final_Project

# This project requires the following files/libraries to run

# Main Code Files
# - mainCode.py
# - convolution.py
# - SimonPlanetsTraining.csv
# - SimonPlanetsTesting.csv (For network evaluation purposes)

# Secondary Code Files
# - dataSetCreation.py (To convert WAV files to spectrograph images and save them to a .csv)

# Libraries
# - Numpy
# - Pandas
# - Matplotlib
# - Librosa

# The purpose of this code is to take user input of planets in the solar system in the form of an audio file and be able to determine which planet was said using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Most of the calculation is handled in the mainCode.py file with the exception of the actual convolution operation and the backpropagation to the CNN's filters.
